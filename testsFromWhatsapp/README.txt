tests for HW3 OS TFTP server 

how to use the tests?
1) run your TFTP server using port number 20000.
2) launch the .sh files that you would like from the terminal. dont add any parameters.
3) check if the system acts as expected.

notes:
1) the bash files sen the packets one by one, it may have a different effect than the client we got from the course's staff.
2) the data files contains junk (random data) but in the correct amuont of bytes and headers, only data 17 is shorter than 516 bytes (including the header).
3) therefor you shouldnt try to alter the data files.
4) obviuosly the ack num of each file is as stated in its name.
5) you can alter the tests using notepad++. if you do, please share with others so they can check their submission as well.

last but not least: Im not taking any responsibility for errors in submission due to using the tests.
